1.  Introduction

   This document separates the provision of authoritative service for
   the "arpa" top-level domain zone from that of the root zone, allowing
   for greater separation of concerns and thus more tailored operations
   based on the unique requirements of each service.

   The arpa top-level domain [RFC3172] is designated as an
   "infrastructure domain" to support techniques defined by Internet
   standards.  Applications of the domain include various types of
   mappings, such as E.164 numbers to URIs, and IP addresses to domain
   names; as well as for non-unique use in residential home networks.

   Historically, the arpa zone has been hosted on almost all of the root
   name servers.  [RFC3172] envisages the arpa domain to be
   "sufficiently critical that the operational requirements for the root
   servers apply to the operational requirements of the "arpa" servers".
   To date, this has been implemented by serving the arpa domain
   directly on a subset of the root server infrastructure.

   This commingling of operations has caused complications.  The
   resulting co-dependency of these two zones have entwined management
   of both their content and their infrastructure.  For example, some
   proposals under consideration in the IETF that involving the arpa
   zone have been discarded due to the risk of conflict with root
   operations.

   The proposed separation also resolves operational impacts of
   synchronizing edits between the management of the root zone and the
   "arpa" zone.  The current dependency has unduly complicated the
   management systems and processes for the root zone.

2.  Requirements for the "arpa" zone

   The arpa top-level domain continues to play a role in critical
   Internet operations, and this change does not propose weakening
   operational requirements described in [RFC3172] for the domain.
   Future operational requirements for arpa shall consider strong
   baseline requirements, such as those documented in [RFC7720].

3.  Transition Process

   To distinguish the operation of the arpa zone from that of the root
   zone, the process would involve initially serving "arpa" from the
   same hosts (i.e. the root servers), but using new hostnames dedicated
   to their role as arpa authorities.

   Once completed, subsequent transitional phases would include using
   new hosts to replace or augment the existing root server hosts, and
   separation of the editing and distribution of the arpa zone from
   necessarily being connected to the root zone.

3.1.  Dedicated nameserver hostnames

   The first phase of separation of service intends to identify a new
   naming scheme for the "arpa" authoritative nameservers.  Removing the
   dependency on the "root-servers.net" zone (which is currently used
   for the root zone authorities) will eliminate a logical dependency
   that requires the coordinated editing of the arpa zone and the root
   zone.

   Consistent with the use of the arpa namespace itself to host name
   servers for other delegations in the arpa zone ([RFC5855]), this
   document specifies a new namespace of "ns.arpa" to be used for this
   purpose, with the nameserver set to be labelled as follows:

      a.ns.arpa
      b.ns.arpa
      c.ns.arpa
      ...

   This component of this transition does not require the underlying
   hosts that provide arpa name service (that is, the root servers) to
   be altered.  The arpa zone will initially map the new hostnames to
   the same IP addresses that already provide service under the
   respective hostnames within root-servers.net.

3.2.  Separation of infrastructure

   After initially migrating the arpa zone to use hostnames that are not
   shared with the root zone, the underlying name service is expected to
   evolve such that it no longer directly aligns to a subset of root
   server instances.  Future novel applications for the arpa zone may be
   pre-conditioned on ensuring there is no shared infrastructure between
   the root servers and the arpa servers.

   Any subequent changes to the parties providing name service for the
   zone is considered a normal management responsibility associated with
   zone management, and would be performed in accordance with [RFC3172].

3.3.  Zone administration

   Publication of the arpa zone file to the authoritative arpa name
   servers is currently undertaken as part of the Root Zone Maintainer
   contract performed under the auspices of ICANN.  Upon the separation
   of the arpa infrastructure from the root server infrastructure,
   publication of the arpa zone no longer necessarily needs to be linked
   or inter-related to the root zone publication mechanisms.

3.4.  Conclusion of process

   Full compartmentalization of arpa operations from root operations
   minimally requires the following to be satisfied:

   o  The arpa zone no longer shares any hostnames in its NS-set with
      the root zone;

   o  The hosts that provide authoritative name service are not the same
      hosts as the root servers, do not share any IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
      with the root servers, and are sufficiently separately provisioned
      such that any unique arpa zone requirements can be deployed
      without affecting how root zone service is provided;

   o  The editorial and publication process for the arpa zone has any
      common dependencies with the root zone process removed, so that
      the arpa zone can be managed, edited and provisioned wholly
      independently of the root zone.

   Such compartmentalization is ultimately sought to allow for novel
   uses of the arpa zone without the risk of inadvertantly impacting
   root zone and root server operations.  It is recognized that
   achieving this state requires a deliberative process involving
   significant coordination to ensure impacts are minimized.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall coordinate the creation of a new "ns.arpa" zone and
   populate it with address records that reflect the IP addresses of the
   contemporary root servers documented within "root-servers.net" as its
   initial state.

   The IANA will initially migrate the 12 NS records for the arpa zone
   to point to their respective new entries in the "ns.arpa" zone.

   Subsequently, IANA will consult and coordinate with all relevant
   parties on activity to reduce or eliminate reliance upon root zone
   and root server infrastructure for serving the arpa zone.  Such
   changes will be performed in compliance with [RFC3172] and shall be
   conducted with all due care and deliberation to mitigate potential
   impacts on critical infrastructure.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   o  Should nameservers for ns.arpa be on the standard IANA
      infrastructure servers i.e. *.iana-servers.net?  Are there any
      special considerations here that need to be documented?

   o  A preference has been expressed for non-.arpa hostnames.  Is it
      better that the nameserver hostnames are in-bailiwick in .arpa or
      does that provide no benefit?

   o  Should the name servers stick to the same letter-based
      nomenclature as the root zone?  Some operators have expressed a
      strong desire to move away from the letters for the root zone.

   o  Should the hostname change be staggered or can it be done in one
      action?
