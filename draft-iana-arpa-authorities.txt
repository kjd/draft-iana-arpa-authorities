1.  Introduction

   This document separates the provision of authoritative service for
   the "arpa" top-level domain zone from that of the root zone, allowing
   for greater separation of concerns and thus more tailored operations
   based on the unique requirements of each service.

   The arpa top-level domain [RFC3172] is specially designated as an
   "infrastructure domain" to support techniques defined by Internet
   standards.  Applications of the domain include various types of
   mappings, such as E.164 numbers to URIs, and IP addresses to domain
   names; as well as for non-unique use in residential home networks.

   Historically, the arpa top-level domain has been hosted on a majority
   of the root name servers.  [RFC3172] envisages the arpa domain to be
   "sufficiently critical that the operational requirements for the root
   servers apply to the operational requirements of the "arpa" servers".
   To date, this has been implemented by serving the arpa domain
   directly on a subset of the root server infrastructure.

   This commingling of operations has caused complications.  The
   resulting co-dependency of these two zones have entwined management
   of both their content and their infrastructure.  For example, some
   proposals under consideration in the IETF that involving the arpa
   zone have been discarded due to the risk of conflict with root
   operations.

   A separation also resolves operational impacts of synchronizing edits
   between the management of the root zone and the "arpa" zone.  This
   dependency has unduly complicated the management systems and
   processes for the root zone.

2.  Requirements for the "arpa" zone

   The arpa top-level domain continues to play a role in critical
   Internet operations, and this change does not propose weakening
   operational requirements described in [RFC3172] for the domain.
   Future operational requirements for arpa shall consider root server
   baseline requirements, such as those documented in [RFC7720].

3.  Transition Process

   The distinguish the operation of the arpa top-level domain zone from
   that of the root zone, the process would involve initially serving
   "arpa" from the same hosts (i.e. the root servers), using new
   hostnames dedicated to their role as arpa authorities.

   Once completed, subsequent phases could include new hosts replacing
   or augmenting the existing root server hosts, and separation of the
   editing and distribution of the arpa zone from necessarily being
   connected to the root zone.

3.1.  Dedicated nameservers

   The first phase of separation of service intends to identify a new
   naming scheme for the "arpa" authoritative nameservers.  Removing the
   dependency on the "root-servers.net" zone which is used for the root
   zone authorities will eliminate a logical dependency that requires
   the coordinated editing of the arpa zone and the root zone.

   Consistent with the use of the arpa namespace itself to host name
   servers for other delegations in the arpa zone ([RFC5855]), this
   document specifies a new namespace of "ns.arpa" to be used for this
   purpose, with the nameserver set to be labelled as follows:

      a.ns.arpa
      b.ns.arpa
      c.ns.arpa
      ...

   This component of this transition does not require the underlying
   hosts that provide arpa name service, the root servers, to be
   altered.  The new hostnames will initially map to the same IP
   addresses that provide service under the respective hostnames within
   root-servers.net.  At the request of individual name server
   operators, the IP addresses may be pointed to alternative IP
   addresses that is managed to the same rigour as their root service.

3.2.  Administration of infrastructure

   Contingent upon migrating the arpa zone to use nameservers nominated
   in NS records that are not shared with the root zone, name service
   may subsequently be evolved such that it no longer directly aligns to
   a subset of root server instances.  Future novel applications for the
   arpa zone may be pre-conditioned on ensuring there is no shared
   infrastructure between the root servers and the arpa servers.

   Any subequent changes to the parties providing name service for the
   zone is considered a normal management responsibility associated with
   zone management, and would be performed in accordance with [RFC3172].

3.3.  Zone administration

   Publication of the arpa zone file to the authoritative arpa name
   servers is currently undertaken as part of the Root Zone Maintainer
   contract performed under the auspices of ICANN.  Upon the separation
   of the arpa infrastructure from the root server infrastructure,
   publication of the arpa zone no longer necessarily needs to be linked
   or inter-related to the root zone publication mechanisms.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall coordinate the creation of a new "ns.arpa" zone and
   populate it with address records that reflect the IP addresses of the
   contemporary root servers documented within "root-servers.net" as its
   initial state.

   The IANA will initially migrate the 12 NS records for the arpa zone
   to point to their respective new entries in the "ns.arpa" zone.

   Subsequently, IANA will consult and coordinate on activity to reduce
   or eliminate reliance upon root zone and root server infrastructure
   for serving the arpa zone.  Such changes will be performed in
   compliance with [RFC3172] and shall be conducted with all due care
   and deliberation to mitigate potential impacts on critical
   infrastructure.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   o  Should nameservers for ns.arpa be on the standard IANA
      infrastructure servers i.e. *.iana-servers.net?  Are there any
      special considerations here that need to be documented?

   o  A preference has been expressed for non-.arpa hostnames.  Is it
      better that the nameserver hostnames are in-bailiwick in .arpa or
      does that provide no benefit?

   o  Should the hostname change be staggered or can it be done in one
      action?
