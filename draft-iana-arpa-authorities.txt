 Nameservers for the Address and Routing Parameter Area ("arpa") Domain
                      draft-iana-arpa-authorities

Abstract

   This document updates the practices associated with nameservers that
   serve the "arpa" DNS zone.  In particular, it describes revisions to
   operational practices to separate function of the zone from its
   historical operation alongside the DNS root zone.

1.  Introduction

   The "arpa" top-level domain [RFC3172] is specially designated as an
   "infrastructure domain" to support techniques defined by Internet
   standards.  Applications of the domain include various types of
   mappings, such as E.164 numbers to URIs, and IP addresses to domain
   names; as well as for non-unique use in residential home networks.

   Historically, the arpa top-level domain has been hosted on a majority
   of the root name servers.  [RFC3172] envisages the arpa domain to be
   "sufficiently critical that the operational requirements for the root
   servers apply to the operational requirements of the "arpa" servers".
   To date, this has been implemented by serving the arpa domain
   directly on the root server infrastructure.

   This commingling of operations has not been without complication.
   Activities that pertain to management of both the content and the
   infrastructure of the root zone and the "arpa" zone have, as a
   consequence, had dependencies upon one another.

   Solutions to certain standardization efforts in the IETF may have
   been addressed by inserting new resource record types in the "arpa"
   zone that had been previously unused.  The highly conservative
   approach used in operating the root zone is resistant to such novel
   applications due to the potential for unintended consequences for the
   root namespace.

   This document separates the provision of authoritative service for
   the root zone and the "arpa" zone, allowing for greater separation of
   concerns and thus more tailored operations based on the unique
   requirements of each service.  Such a separation resolves challenges
   that has impacted operations that necessitated coordinated edits

   between the management of the root zone and the "arpa" zone.  This
   dependency has unduly complicated the management systems and
   processes for the root zone.

2.  Requirements for the "arpa" zone

   [TBD]

3.  Transition Process

3.1.  Dedicated nameservers

   The first phase of separation of service intends to identify a new
   naming scheme for the "arpa" authoritative nameservers.  Removing the
   dependency on the "root-servers.net" zone which is used for the root
   zone authorities with eliminate a logical dependency that the the
   "arpa" zone has that necessitates the coordinated editing of the arpa
   zone and the root zone.

   Consistent with the use of the arpa namespace itself to support other
   delegations in the arpa zone ([RFC5855]), this document specifies a
   new namespace of "ns.arpa" to be used for this purpose, with the
   nameserver set to be labelled as follows:

      a.ns.arpa
      b.ns.arpa
      c.ns.arpa
      ...

   This component of this transition does not require the underlying
   hosts that provide "arpa" name servers to be altered.  Therefore the
   new hostnames may map to the same IP addresses that provide service
   under the respective hostnames within root-servers.net.  At the
   request of individual name server operators, the IP addresses may be
   pointed to alternative IP addresses that is managed to the same
   rigour as their root service.

3.2.  Administration of infrastructure

   Contingent upon migrating the "arpa" zone to use nameservers
   nominated in NS records that are not shared with the root zone, name
   service may subsequently be altered such that it no longer directly
   aligns to a subset of root server instances.  As part of the joint
   management of the "arpa" zone by the IAB and the IANA, the
   requirements of the "arpa" zone may vary over time as part of a
   routine re-assessment of requirements.  This is part of the normal
   management responsibilities for the zone, and may include selection
   of different nameserver operators and reconfiguration of the NS set.

3.3.  Zone administration

   Publication of the "arpa" zone file to the authoritative "arpa" name
   servers is currently undertaken as part of the Root Zone Maintainer
   contract performed under the auspices of ICANN.  Upon the separation
   of the "arpa" infrastructure from the root server infrastructure,
   publication of the "arpa" zone no longer necessarily needs to be
   linked or inter-related to the root zone publication mechanisms.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall coordinate the creation of a new "ns.arpa" zone and
   populate it with address records that reflect the IP addresses of the
   contemporary root servers documented within "root-servers.net" as its
   initial state. []

   The IANA shall migrate the 12 NS records for the "arpa" zone to point
   to their respective new entries in the "ns.arpa" zone.

   Subsequently, the IANA may make changes to the NS set based on
   operational revisions as coordinated with the IAB.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   o  Any need to specify baseline requirements for the .arpa zone
      moving forward, as it pertains to this proposal?  It is not clear
      if the assumption quoted from [RFC3172] of having parity
      requirements with root servers still holds true.

   o  Ideally provide historical context on how arpa came to be served
      on the root servers.

Internet-Draft      Nameservers for the .arpa Domain       November 2019


   o  Can nameservers for ns.arpa shall be the standard IANA
      infrastructure servers i.e. *.iana-servers.net?  Are there any
      special considerations here that need to be documented?

   o  RZM has a preference for non-.arpa hostnames.  Is it better that
      the nameserver hostnames are in-bailiwick in .arpa or does that
      provide no benefit?

   o  Would the hostname change need to be phased or can it be done in
      one action?

   o  Consider impact of prospective new "arpa" entries described in
      draft-rosenbergjennings-dispatch-ripp-03 and draft-grover-add-
      policy-detection-00.
